# 2017 FIRST Tech Challenge team 13151 Creative Adventure Lab

## Background

### What does this code do?

It runs a robot for the 2017 FIRST Tech Challenge Relic Recovery game

### What is FIRST Tech Challenge?

It's a robotics competition. Click [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/what-is-first-tech-challenge) for some more information on it

### How did the team do?

Pretty well for rookies. We were eliminated at the Iowa league tournament but did get picked as an alliance member in the final elimination matches and ended up getting some participation award. Previous to that tournament we were in first place (later knocked down to second) in our league.

## The Code

### Breakdown of Files

**Note:** There's no gurantee that any of the autonomous files are named properly or are functioning as you would expect. Previous to the last day they were correct and able to perform full-point autonomous, but our last meet was very hectic and innvolved a lot of last minute code changes

**TeleOp**

```
Driver.java - Driver file
```

**Autonomous**

```
StMchAutoBluPara.java - Blue parallel layout file
StMchAutoBluPerp.java - Blue perpendicular layout file
StMchAutoRedPara.java - Red parallel layout file
StMchAutoRedPerp.java - Red perpendicular layout file
```

**Utility**

```
StateMachine.java - State machine interface file. See acknowledgments below for information on where this file came from
```
